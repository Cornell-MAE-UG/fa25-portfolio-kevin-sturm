In our System Dynamics class, we were tasked with the job of researching and modeling a complex system and applying the concepts we had used throughout the year. We chose to look into a quadcopter, and model how the system responds to user input to achieve a desired angle. I worked in a group with 3 other students, and worked to derive the ODEs that govern the system and create a simple animation of the observed behavior.
