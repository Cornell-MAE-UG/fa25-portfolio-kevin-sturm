In our Fluid Mechanics class, we were tasked with the job of taking apart, analyzing, and putting back together a fluid machine. From this, we were expected to figure out how it works and explain it to other fluid mechanics students. I worked in a group with 3 other students, and we broke the system down into a series of nozzles and explored what forced a mixture of propane and air to burn.  
Specifically, I worked on analyzing how the flow changed across each nozzle, and how we could condense them into one system. I did a lot of the analysis on the nozzles and estimations of their effects.
