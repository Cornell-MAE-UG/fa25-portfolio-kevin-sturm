## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a current Junior at Cornell University's College of Engineering. I will be graduating with a B.S in Mechanical Engineering by Spring 2027, and plan on continuing to pursue a Master's in Mechanical Engineering by Fall 2027. In addition to being a full time student, I am an active member on Combat Robotics @ Cornell, and a student athlete who competes in Ironman events.

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
