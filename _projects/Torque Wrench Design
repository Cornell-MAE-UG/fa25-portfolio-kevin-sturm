In our Materials class, we were assigned the job of modifying a torque wrench design to meet a number of specifications. The guidelines put forward were that it must be able to experience a fully reversed torque of T = ±600 in-lbf for 1,000,000 cycles. It must have a safety factor of 4 for yield or brittle failure, 2 for crack growth (for an assumed crack of .04 in), 1.5 for fatigue stress safety, and be made out of an aluminum, steel, or titanium alloy. The goal was to maximize the torque wrench's sensitivity, achieving a minimum of 1mV/V.  

I worked with a partner to slightly modify the geometry and create a Matlab script to iterate through a variety of different materials, bring us to Ti-6Al-4V, which has a high strength to weight ratio and good fracture toughness. Specifically, it has a Young's modulus of E = 17300psi and a Poisson's ratio of 0.37. You can see our basic dimensions below:

In order to correctly restrain our Ansys model, we ensured the location of the drive would not move and the face of the handle would experience a load that would give it a torque of 600 in-lbf, as seen below:

After this, we looked specifically at how the strain and stress were distributed on the torque wrench:

</p>

Important values found in our analysis include:  
Maximum normal stress: 41884psi
Load point deflection: 0.2908in
Strain at strain gauge: 0.0013067 in/in  
Using this strain gauge, we find that our strain gauge has a sensitivbity of .00131 in/in, or 1.3 mV/V.  

When designing this torque wrench, we would need to select an appropriate strain gauge. The one we would use is the Omega SGD-2/350-LY13. It is about .079 in x .0984 in, so it would fit easily onto the torque wrench.  

We met all of the design requirements, and exceeded the minimum torque sensitivity by more than 30% of the goal.
